Reflections on challenges faced and how they were resolved.

What parts of the project did you get stuck on?
    - Insert seemed trivial at first, but I underestimated the different cases that could come up and cause things to break. I 
    used the method Gerdin went through in the last lecture to specify my inputs, output, and different cases that might come up to 
    resolve the challenge.

Why were you stuck?
    - I was stuck because I was impulsive to start implementing right away rather than take a step back and think 
    through the problem and what might come up.

What information did you need to get unblocked?
    - No outside information; I needed to walk through the problem carefully as Gerdin explained.

How did you know you needed that information?
    - I was jumping too fast to implement the solution.

How did you find that information?
    - I looked back through the lecture video.
